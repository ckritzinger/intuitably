We live our lives in states of highly imperfect information.  We try to make sense of what we observe to be happening around us by relying on a [series of biological hacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye) to turn stimuli into electrical impulses. This is flawed in numerous and interesting ways.

A large part of what we observe revolves around the actions and words of the people around us. And based on what we observe, we react.  But we don't react directly to the observation. Instead we build a mental model of the emotional and mental state of the person when they said or did the thing.  We infer their intent.

So a typical interaction looks a bit like this:

1. You have an intention (A)
2. You say or do something based on this intention
3. I see you say or do that thing
4. I filter this observation through my own special set of biases and preconceptions.
5. Based on what remains, I construct an interpretation of your intent (B)
6. I react to  my interpretation of your intent.
7. Hilarity ensues

My reaction to your action is based on my own construction, rather than what you actually meant.  And the world is a worse place.

Luckily, this pattern is easy to break.  Just be curious.  Ask “what did you mean when you said that?” or “why did you do that?” and listen carefully to the answer.
